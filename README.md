# Traxxcloud

## Motivations

Soundcloud is definitely a great place to be, an amazing website with high-quality
sounds. but I felt annoyed by very long DJ sets while I was only looking for amateur
tracks. Similarly, sometimes I don't want to get highly popular tracks with thousands
of likes and repost on my dashboard, only nice tracks procuced and shared by my 
network.
